		<h2>WANNA KNOW OUR STORY?</h2>
       
		<p><h2>October 28 was the day it all started. That evening when i first saw her i was completly stunned. She just looked just like a cute little princess. i just stared at her. I knew she was getting a bit uncomfortable but i could not  help myself. she just looked stunning. At last it was time to bid her farewell for the day but i was not able to get the butterfies out of my stomach. you are the most cutest and most sweet thing that has ever happened to me. happy valentine's day anjali. i know sometimes we do fight a lot. some times its my mistake and sometimes its both of us. but if till to this date after so much fighting we are still together its our efforts and contributions for this realtionship. i never even thought i would get a girl like you who is ready to put everything on the line to do so much for the relationship.</p></h2>

        <p><h2>
            At first for some months i did not think that this relationship will last for a long time. maybe she will cheat like the others did, maybe she will start liking anyone other as time passes. but you proved me wrong. you stayed and we made it to this day. Thank you so much anjali for everything you have done.
